# QDP (Qureshi Device Protocol)

## 1. Purpose of QDP
QDP (Qureshi Device Protocol) is designed to facilitate secure, lightweight communication between devices in a distributed environment. It is optimized for embedded systems, SCADA environments, and IoT devices, enabling them to send commands, receive telemetry data, and ensure reliable operations for remote devices.

## 2. Protocol Stack and Communication Model

### Layered Architecture
- **Physical Layer**: Hardware interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.).
- **Data Link Layer**: Error detection and link management.
- **Network Layer**: Addressing and routing (if required).
- **Transport Layer**: Serial (UART)/TCP/UDP for reliable or lightweight transmission.
- **QDP Layer**: Defines how messages are structured, validated, and handled.

### Communication Models
- **Client-Server**: Devices (clients) send requests/data to a central server or gateway.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Devices communicate directly when required.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Devices publish data to a message broker (for telemetry), and other devices subscribe.

## 3. Message Structure
QDP messages are concise but flexible, allowing for command execution, telemetry reporting, and error handling.

### Message Format

```
[HEADER]
[COMMAND/TELEMETRY]
[DATA]
[CHECKSUM/CRC]
```

- **Header**: Type of message (command, response, telemetry), protocol version, and optionally device ID or session ID.
- **Command/Telemetry**: Indicates the command issued or telemetry being reported.
- **Data**: Optional field for command parameters or telemetry data.
- **Checksum/CRC**: Ensures data integrity.

## 4. Commands and Responses
Define standard commands and responses:

### Commands
- `0x10`: Get Device Ids
- `0x11`: Get Telemetry Info

### Responses
- `0x20`: Acknowledgment (ACK)
- `0x21`: Error (ERR) + Error Code
- `0x22`: Telemetry Report

## 5. Error Handling
QDP supports the following error codes:
- `ERR_TIMEOUT`
- `ERR_UNRECOGNIZED_COMMAND`
- `ERR_DEVICE_BUSY`
- `ERR_UNKNOWN_DEVICE`

Devices should handle these gracefully and retry operations if necessary.

## 6. Security
Security is crucial in SCADA and IoT systems. QDP should implement:
- **Encryption**: TLS or lightweight encryption for secure communication.
- **Authentication**: Device certificates or pre-shared keys (PSKs).
- **Replay Protection**: Use sequence numbers or timestamps to prevent replay attacks.

## 7. Flow Control and Reliability
To ensure reliable communication:
- **ACK Messages**: Use explicit acknowledgment (ACK) and retries for important commands.
- **Timeouts & Retries**: Implement timers to retry operations if no response is received.

## 8. Extensibility
QDP should be extensible to accommodate future changes and enhancements:

- **Versioning**: Messages should contain a version number to allow backward compatibility.
- **Custom Commands**: Support vendor-specific commands and telemetry types for different devices.

### Next Steps
1. **Message Parser**: Build a parser to construct and parse QDP messages.
2. **Command Handler**: Implement a handler to process incoming commands and send responses.
3. **Device Simulation**: Simulate devices for testing in different scenarios.
4. **Transport Layer**: Use TCP/UDP/MQTT or a custom transport layer as needed.
